My name is Zicheng Ma, and I am currently a graduate student at Harvard University, pursuing a degree in Computational Science and Engineering. I hold dual undergraduate degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Zhejiang University, graduating with Highest Honors. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in computer systems, machine learning, and distributed computing, which has been enriched by hands-on research and practical industry experiences.

This summer, I had the opportunity to intern with NVIDIA’s Dynamo team, where I contributed to building robust distributed systems tailored for large language model inference. Prior to that, I interned with Microsoft’s Deep Kernel Infrastructure (DKI) group, where I gained valuable insights into machine learning integration for system optimization and cloud services. Additionally, I collaborated with Xudong Sun at UIUC’s x-lab on the verifiable controller framework Anvil; our work was accepted to OSDI 24 and honored with the Best Paper award, reflecting my dedication to advancing secure and reliable system designs.

Beyond my technical work, I am an avid coffee enthusiast. Brewing and savoring pour-over coffee has become an integral part of my daily routine. I particularly enjoy light roast coffees with bright acidity and clean flavors—notes of jasmine, citrus, and strawberry not only excite my palate but also inspire a sense of happiness and calm that fuels my passion for innovation. This balance between rigorous engineering and appreciation of subtle sensory experiences defines both my personal and professional ethos.
