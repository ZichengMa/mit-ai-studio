Here is his introduction about his hobby:
I am a deep coffee lover.☕️ Drinking and brewing coffee has become an unattainable part of my life. I love drinking pour-over coffee and prefer light roast coffee with good acidity and cleanliness. Every time I taste those wonderful flavors in coffee, such as jasmine, citrus, strawberry, etc., I feel a sense of happiness.
