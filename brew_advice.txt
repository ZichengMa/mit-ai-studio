## Step-By-Step Brewing Method

### 1. Preparation  
- Heat water to 93°C.  
- Grind 20 g Panama Washed Geisha to medium-fine/medium, ensuring consistency for optimal flow with Orea's fine filtration.  
- Place Orea filter in your pour-over dripper, rinse thoroughly with hot water to eliminate paper flavors and preheat the brewer. Discard rinse water.

### 2. Bloom Phase (0:00 – 0:45 seconds)  
- Start timer at zero as you pour 40 ml of water evenly in a slow circular motion to saturate all grounds thoroughly. Take care to pour gently from the center outward and back to ensure no grounds remain dry.  
- Let the coffee bloom for 45 seconds to allow degassing, which facilitates better extraction.

### 3. First Pour (0:45 – 1:30)  
- Begin pouring water from the center outward in concentric circles to reach 150 ml total water volume (additional 110 ml water added after the 40 ml bloom).  
- Pour steadily and slowly to maintain an even extraction and avoid disrupting the coffee bed. Maintain a consistent water flow rate.  

### 4. Second Pour (1:30 – 2:15)  
- Continue pouring gently in circular motions to increase water volume to 225 ml total (additional 75 ml added).  
- Focus on maintaining even saturation and avoid direct pouring on the filter walls.

### 5. Final Pour (2:15 – 3:30)  
- Pour remaining 75 ml of water slowly in a controlled circular pattern, completing the total 300 ml dose.  
- Allow the brewed coffee to drip fully without agitation or pressing grounds. Total brew time should reach approximately 3 minutes 30 seconds.

## Tasting Notes and Why This Works

- Water temperature at 93°C optimally extracts the floral jasmine, bergamot, and fruit acidity without extracting bitterness.  
- The 1:15 ratio strikes a balance, preserving brightness and delivering body without thinning out the cup.  
- Medium-fine grind with Orea filter maximizes flow and extraction efficiency, preventing clogging while capturing the coffee’s delicate oils and aromas.  
- Circular pouring ensures even water distribution for uniform extraction and avoids channeling.  
- Extended brew time up to 3:30 deepens sweetness and texture, highlighting the ultra-light roast’s unique flavor profile, while the Orea filter’s clarity avoids muddiness or harshness.  
- Resulting cup is bright yet smooth, with a clean finish, silky mouthfeel, and distinct notes of jasmine, bergamot, mango, and citrus—emphasizing the specialty quality of this coffee in an ecologically mindful way.

## Additional Tips  
- Use freshly ground beans right before brewing.  
- Adjust grind slightly coarser if flow slows excessively or if over-extracted flavors present.  
- Experiment with ratio between 1:15 and 1:17 if you want a lighter or fuller body, adjusting accordingly.  
- Serve immediately to enjoy peak aroma and flavor.
